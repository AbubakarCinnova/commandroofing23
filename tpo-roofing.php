    <h2>TPO (Thermoplastic Polyolefin) Roofing</h2>
    <p>TPO (Thermoplastic Polyolefin) commercial and industrial roofing is a single-ply roofing material that has gained
        popularity for its numerous advantages. Here are the key advantages of using TPO roofing:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> TPO roofing is available in light-colored membranes, which reflect
            sunlight and reduce heat absorption. This can lead to lower cooling costs during hot weather, making it an
            energy-efficient roofing option.</li>
        <li><strong>Durability:</strong> TPO roofing is known for its durability and resistance to environmental
            factors, such as UV radiation, ozone exposure, and chemical damage. It can withstand various weather
            conditions and has good puncture resistance.</li>
        <li><strong>Waterproofing:</strong> TPO roofing provides excellent waterproofing, preventing water infiltration
            and potential leaks. The seams of TPO membranes are typically heat-welded, creating a strong and watertight
            seal.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> TPO roofing is flexible and can adapt to different roof shapes and designs,
            including curved surfaces. It can accommodate various architectural styles without compromising its
            performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Lightweight:</strong> TPO roofing is lightweight compared to some other roofing materials, which can
            be beneficial for new construction and reroofing projects, as it reduces the load on the building's
            structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Chemical Resistance:</strong> TPO roofing is resistant to chemical exposure, making it suitable for
            commercial and industrial buildings where chemical pollutants may be present.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> TPO roofing is often more cost-effective compared to other roofing
            materials like PVC or EPDM, making it an attractive choice for budget-conscious projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Compatibility with Insulation:</strong> TPO roofing membranes can be easily adhered to or
            mechanically fastened over various types of roof insulation, providing effective insulation and improving
            the building's energy efficiency.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>New Roofs:</strong> TPO is often chosen due to its energy efficiency, durability, and ease of
        installation. It offers an excellent solution for architects and contractors looking for a single-ply roofing
        system that can provide reliable performance and energy savings.</p>

    <p><strong>Reroofing:</strong> TPO roofing can be an efficient choice. It can be installed directly over the
        existing roof (in a roof-over or recovery installation) if the underlying structure is still in good condition.
        This approach reduces the cost and time associated with tearing off the old roof, making it a cost-effective
        option for refurbishing older buildings.</p>
